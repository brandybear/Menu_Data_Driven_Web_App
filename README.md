# Menu_Data_Driven_Web_App
Going through the Full Stack Foundations class on Udacity :)

Created a data driven web app listing several restaurants and their respective menus.  Users have the ability to add, edit, and delete menu items for the restaurants.

Created using SQLAlchemy and Flask.  Coded mostly in Python with bits of HTML and some CSS.
